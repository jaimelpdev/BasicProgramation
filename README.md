Welcome to the BasicProgramation repository! This project is designed to help beginners learn the fundamentals of programming through a series of exercises and examples. Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your skills, this repository provides a range of resources to get you started.

This is everything I have been doing throughout 1ÂºCFGS DAW.
